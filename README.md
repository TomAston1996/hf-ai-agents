# ü§ó Hugging Face AI Agents Course

This repository is purely for learning purposes and tracks Hugging Face's new AI Agents course. 

The course encompasses five units, covering topics such as agent fundamentals, 
frameworks like smolagents, LlamaIndex, and LangGraph, and real-world use cases. It includes hands-on assignments, including building and deploying their own AI agents.
The course is structured over six weeks, with new units released bi-weekly, and includes live sessions, written materials,
and interactive quizzes.
